# TextCodecs

A personal and experimental codec system — part language, part ritual, part system design.  
This is the seed repo for developing the `TextCodecs` engine, a tool for encoding/decoding custom symbol stacks, name scrolls, and sacred structures.

## ✨ Vision
TextCodecs aims to:
- Encode structured meaning using symbols, glyphs, and rule sets
- Support layered scrolls (visual + verbal + metadata)
- Become part of a sovereign OS or toolkit (e.g., ZTOOL_64C)
